.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm _printf() \" Section Header - required - don't modify
.\ft Prints to the standard output under the control of a format string that specifies how subsequent arguments are converted for output.

.Sh Format string
.Pp
    The format string is composed of 0 or more directives
    (ordinary characters that are not %),
    which are copied to the output stream.
.Pp
    The format string is also composed of conversion specifications,
    each of which result in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.
.Pp
    Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %
    and ends with the conversion specifier.
.Pp
    The argument must correspond properly with the conversion specifier.
    By default, the arguments are used in the order given.


.Sh Conversion Specifiers
    A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied.
    The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
.Pp
    \fB c :\fR The int argument is converted to an \fI unsigned char \fR,
    then the resulting character is written.
.Pp
    \fB s :\fR The \fI const char *\fR argument is expected to be a pointer
    to an array of character type (pointer to a string).
    Characters from the array are written up to a terminating null byte,
    but do ot include the terminating null byte.
.Pp
    \fB d, i :\fR The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
.Pp
    \fB % :\fR  A '%' is written but no argument is converted.
    The complete version specification is '%%'
.Pp

.Sh Return value
    On successful return, these functions return the number of characters
    printed, excluding the null byte used to end output to strings.
.Pp
    If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.
.El                      \" Ends the list
